# use-my-blood

This repo is for a project intended to help people with Hemochromotosis in areas where the local blood bank does not take blood from people with the condition.  I am one of the affected people and this is the beginning of trying to solve the problem.

Giving blood is the treatment for the condition, and it's pefectly safe to be used to save lives and treat other patients with the condition.  In my city I have to go to the hospital to give blood, instead of the Red Cross.  Due to that, my insurance is billed hundreds of dollars and the blood is thrown away.

☝️ That waste of money and blood is what I aim to solve.
