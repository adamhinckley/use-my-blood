# use-my-blood

This repo is for a project intended to help people with Hemochromatosis in areas where the local blood bank does not take blood from people with the condition. I am one of the affected people and this is the beginning of trying to solve the problem.

Giving blood is the treatment for Hemochromatosis, and it's perfectly safe to be used to save lives. In my city I have to go to the hospital to give blood, instead of the Red Cross. Due to that, my insurance is billed hundreds of dollars a month and the blood is thrown away.

☝️ That waste of money and blood is what I aim to solve.
